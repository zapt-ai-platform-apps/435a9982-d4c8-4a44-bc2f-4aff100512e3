# Sniper Simulation

This journey walks you through simulating a sniper shot under real-world conditions.

## Steps

1. **Initiate Simulation**
   - Locate the Sniper Simulation component on the main interface.
   - Click the "Engage Simulation" button to start the calculation.

2. **Simulation Process**
   - A loading state will indicate that the simulation is running.
   - The simulation calculates parameters such as wind speed, bullet drop, and distance based on randomized values.

3. **Review Simulation Results**
   - Once complete, the simulation results will be displayed.
   - Analyze the results to understand the impact of environmental factors.

4. **Re-run Simulation**
   - Use the button to run the simulation again for different conditions.
   - Each simulation run will provide new insights into the variables affecting your shot.
